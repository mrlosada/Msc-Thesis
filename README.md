# Msc-Thesis
These codes were used to compute the results of the Msc Thesis: 'Observing subradiant dynamics in atomic arrays' by María Rodríguez Losada. In this Msc Thesis, an alternate formulation of the quantum jump method was implemented to solve the dynamic of a 1D atomic array. This formulation allows to treat systems where the effect of dissipation is much slower than other dynamical timescales for the system.
